# Method and Preparation for a LARGE pizza, size is adjusted according to proportion.

- Add water to your flour, depends on how hard or soft you want the base to be, add different amount of water.(Maybe about 500mL to 750mL for 1kg of flour).
- Add salt (2 teaspoon) and egg white (2-4 egg whites) and yeast (10mg)to the flour.
- Massage the flour so that the ingredients are perfectly mixed. The resulting dough should be a wet and soft material and make it a bread shape (so not that soft).
- Let the shaped dough sit for approximately 30 minutes.
- Use a pan and make the dough into the pan's shape (in other word give it a pizza look) and butter it.
- Spread approximately 100mL of tomatoe sause on the pizza dough.
- Spread as much cheese as you like (do not exceed 1 cm from the dough though), and spread pepperoni on top of the cheese.
- Now you have a pre cooked pepperoni pizza.

# Cooking Process

- Put the uncooked pizza in the over and turn temperature to 200-300C
- let the pizza be cooked for 10-15 minutes

# NOTE PIZZA WILL BE EXTREMELY HOT, be careful removing the pizza.
